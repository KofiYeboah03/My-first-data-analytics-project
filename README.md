## Formula One Racing Data from 1950 to 2023

This project aims to perform simple data visualizations, specifically using bar charts, on Formula One racing data found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020. The dataset covers racing data from 1950 to 2023. The data analysis was performed using the R software.

**Note:** This analysis will focus only on the racing data available in the dataset (1950-2023). At the end of this project, we should know the following:

- The total number of races that have been driven from 1950 to 2023.
- How many races have taken place at each grand prix from 1950 to 2023.
